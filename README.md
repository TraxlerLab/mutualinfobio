# mutualinfobio

**mutualinfobio** is an R package for computing mutual information (MI) and coevolutionary scores from protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), with built-in support for FASTA and plain-text input formats. The package includes visualization tools such as MI heatmaps.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

To install the development version directly from GitHub:

```r
install.packages("remotes")  # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("TraxlerLab/mutualinfobio")
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example usage

```r
library(mutualinfobio)

# Load an example alignment from the Cell 2008 paper by Weigt et al.
path <- system.file("extdata", "cell3925mmc4.fasta", package = "mutualinfobio")

# Construct an Alignment object
aln <- Alignment(alignment_path = path)

# Compute mutual information-based covariance scores
mi_scores <- getMICovarianceScore(aln)

# Visualize as a heatmap
draw_MI_heatmap(
  data = mi_scores,
  alignment_labels = c("GeneA", "GeneB"),
  alignment_label_locations = c(1, 50),
  alignment_domain_residues = c(50, 100),
  heatmap_lines = TRUE
)
```
